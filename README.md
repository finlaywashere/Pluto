# Pluto - A modular 3D printed rocket

This project is meant to build and launch an ultra light composite rocket with an onboard computer and sensor array.

The rocket is controlled by two onboard Arduino based computers that have been specialized and turned into custom PCBs for the tasks of instrument monitoring and parachute control.
It features a fully electronically controlled parachute as well as sensors for altitude, pressure, temperature, humidity, and acceleration and gyroscopic position in every axis.
